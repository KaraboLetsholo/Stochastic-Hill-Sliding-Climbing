# Stochastic-Hill-Sliding-Climbing
This is a script for normal stochastic hill climbing, it optimizes a given function by iteratively exploring the solution space. The optimization process involves generating random perturbations to the current solution and accepting or rejecting these perturbations based on their impact on the objective function.

# How to use it

## 1. Create a virtual environment:
```python
python -m venv .venv
```

The virtual environment will allow you to run the project is a environment with all the dependecies need.

## 2. Clone github repo
