# Stochastic-Hill-Sliding-Climbing
This is a script for normal stochastic hill climbing, #it optimizes a given function by iteratively exploring the solution space. The optimization process involves generating random perturbations to the current solution and accepting or rejecting these perturbations based on their impact on the objective function.
